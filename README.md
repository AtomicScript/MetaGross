# MetaGross
Welcome to my first step into algorithmic trading. This project is part of my Zero to Quant blog series, where I document my journey from learning technical indicators to building full trading bots in Python.

## Project Vision
The goal of MetaGross is to turn traditional technical analysis into automated trading systems, and gradually evolve toward quantitative and machine learning–driven models.

### I want to:
- Build trading strategies based on real market data
- Backtest their performance
- Automate the profitable ones using bots
- Log and review every trade
- Continuously improve the models


### Buidling Models
- [ ] Technical Analysis Models
- [ ] Quantitative / Statistical Models
- [ ] Machine Learning 



## Solution Objectives
- ✅ Must backtest every strategy
- ✅ Must display PnL visually and numerically
- ✅ Must support automated trading execution
- ✅ Must journal each trade (entry/exit/logic/result)
- ✅ Must include a risk management framework
